## project1 questions
1.	Write a code that return digit number. 
2.	We have only !, &&, || and <. Write >, >=, <=, == and != comparisons.
3.	User writes day, hour, min and sec. Prepare it for order.
4.	Use a function that controls if the number is even.
5.	Find the sum of digits of a number given by user.
6.	Write a code that converts number to its invers. Ex: 1234 to 4321
7.	Write a code that takes input numbers from user until user says no. After, code writes total number, min, max, mean.
8.	Write a code that flushs standard input buffer until takes new line.
9.	Write a code that shows Collatz. If the number is even, num/2. If the number is odd, 3num +1.
10.	Write a code that calculates factorial of a number.
11.	Write a code that calculates user defined terms converge to in 1 -1/3 +1/5 -1/7... series.
12.	Write a code that prints starts to standard input as number entered by user.
13.	Write a code that prints the prime factors of a number.
14.	Write a code that calculates given year is leap.
15.	Write a code that to find the day of the year on the given date.
16.	Write a code that generates random passwords with 6 - 10 characters.

## project2 questions
1.	Write a code that creates random arrays and prints them.
2.	Write a code that gives the sum of random array.
3.	Write a code that calculates standard deviation of an array.
4.	Write a code that finds the maximum number of an array.
5.	Write a code that finds runner-up of an array. (Second maximum)
6.	Write a code that reverses the array.
7.	Write a linear search algorithm that takes key from the user.
8.	Write a Bubble sort algorithm.
9.	Write a swap function for the array. (pointer)
10.	Write a Merge array algorithm.
11.	Wrtie a code with Bubble sort which shows odd numbers first then evens.

## project3 questions
1.	Write a code that takes all the input lines till the new line comes.
2.	Write a code that calculates the length of input string.
3.	Write a code that add exclamation at the end of the string and writes it to standard input.
4.	Write a code that counts the specific character.
5.	Write a code that compares two given strings like strcmp.
6.	Write a code that takes string from user and deletes specified character from that string.
7.	Write a code that reverses the taken string.
8.	Write a code that gives the number of words given.

## project4 questions
1.	Write a code that displays arrays with pointers.
2.	Write a function that calculates the arithmetic mean of an array whose elements are of type int.
3.	Write a function that reverses the elements of an array whose elements are of type int.
4.	Write the code that will give the min and max of the given array.
5.	Write the code that Bubble sort an integer array.
6.	Write the code that copies an array to another array.
7.	Write the selection sort algorithm for an array.

5.	Write a code that works like strcat.
6.	Write a code that works like strcmp.	
7.	Write a code that finds is there a specific text at the end of another text. 
8.	Write a code that swap without looking the types. (Generic swap)
9.	Write a code that reverses array without looking the types. (Generic reverse)
10.	Write a code that resets (0) the desired number of elements starting from a specific index.
11.	Write a code that works like memset.
12. Write a code that works like memcpy.
